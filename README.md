# Advent Of Code 2021

All code written in Rust. All puzzles solved by myself.

This was the first year I participated in this challenge. Well, challenge,
mainly a challenge to myself. So the goal was not to solve the puzzles
as soon as possible, but as elegantly as possible - within reason.

I should have documented how I solved each puzzle in a `README.md` for it, but I
did not, at least not for all of them. And I should have, because a couple of the
first ones I solved in a `golfy` way. Mainly because I liked how succinct I could
get a solution - not necessarily readable, though. A lesson for next year, I guess.

Anyway. I enjoyed doing this, and I am happy to be able to say I came up with
a solution for every puzzle by myself. Well, that is - I did use the Dijkstra
algorithm in one case, and I did google it. But, that just means I used the
knowledge I already had to find the correct solution. I think I am excused.
After all, nobody expects us to invent mathematics from first principles to
solve these puzzles, right? :)

Thanks, [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) !
